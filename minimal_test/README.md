# Minimal Test

This directory contains a minimal test data set and runners. The purpose of these tests is to show parity against the `germline` code from `a1bdd07d84dd5ac69725c7566cab6ebb42c8e443`. 

## Resoources

* list of old dog keys (plink and txt format)
* list of new dog keys (plink and txt format)
* compiled germline binary from `a1bdd07d84dd5ac69725c7566cab6ebb42c8e443`
* compiled rust code for Mac (local testing)
* Runner script to run the old germline binary with old-new compset, and new-new compsets and the follow-up rust code
* Runner script to run the new germline binary with old-new compset, and new-new compsets
